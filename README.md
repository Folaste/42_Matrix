# Matrix

Project to learn Linear Algebra with Matrix and Vectors.

## History

The complex_list folder contains the 1st version of the project, which was quickly abandoned because it wasn't generic.

Instead, there are 2 folders after a misunderstanding about the second bonus:
 - The complex_builtin folder, which contains the Vector and Matrix classes using the complex type available in vanilla Python3.10.
 - The complex_created folder, which contains the same classes, but using a Complex class.

For each exercise, the 4 classes are imported with the following names B_[Class] for the built-in complex type and C_[Class] for the complex type created by my Complex class.
